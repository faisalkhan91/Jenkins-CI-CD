# Jenkins-CI-CD
This is a project to create CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins.

Here I create a job in ansible that allows us to print an HTML table with CSS that does a query to a database using php based on the input.
The tools and technologies used here are: Jenkins, Ansible, Docker, Nginx, PHP, MySQL, SQL.
